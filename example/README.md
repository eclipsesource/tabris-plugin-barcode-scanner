# Tabris.js Barcode Scanner Example

## Prerequisites

To run the example it is recommended to use the [Tabris.js CLI](https://www.npmjs.com/package/tabris-cli).

The example can not be run directly from this directory since cordova doesn't allow to consume plugins if they are contained in a parent folder. Instead copy the example to an unrelated directory and adjust the `config.xml` of the example to point the `tabris-plugin-barcode-scanner` directory.

## Running the Example

Using the Tabris.js CLI the example can be started by running:

```sh
$ tabris run <platform>
```
